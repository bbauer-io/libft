# libft
Every 42 student’s initiation is to become intimately familiar with the C standard library by recoding it.

My libft includes a collection of 50+ C standard libarary functions, rewritten by myself, for use on all 42 projects, plus an additional ~60 functions that I’ve found useful, from the C library as well as my own imagination.
